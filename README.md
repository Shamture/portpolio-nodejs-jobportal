Job Portal project in node.js using express.js and mongodb.

The main aim of this project is to build a user-friendly project (API's) in node.js using express.js framework. 
Mongodb is used to save data in NoSql database.

The API's we will make in this porject so far are:

1- /api/locations
2- /api/jobTypes
3- /api/advertisements
